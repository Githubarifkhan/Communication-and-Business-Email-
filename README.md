# Communication-and-Business-Email-

Here are six elements every business email should include: 
A clear subject line

An appropriate greeting

A concise message

A closing that states what action is expected

A sign-off

### A signature that includes your contact information Communication has changed! The traditional rules for speaking and presenting, meeting coordination, influencing people, negotiating and selling ideas no longer apply in a world of skype, messenger, video and teleconference. This course will act as an overview on several concepts each of which could be a course of their own and our goal is to give you tools that you can practice and perfect on your own.
